<h1 align="center"> Senac Login Form </h1>

The main goal of this project is to provide a foundation for creating a functional login form in a web application, from structuring HTML elements to visual styling and data validation with JavaScript. While it does not authenticate with the actual Senac website, it offers a learning opportunity for developers who wish to create login forms in their own projects.
